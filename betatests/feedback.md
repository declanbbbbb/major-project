# Feedback from Beta-testers

## Arman Borhan
*Created 'ball bounce beta'*

>first of all, it was really fun, it's a cool library that adds a bunch of different ways to display things

>I really had a smooth time learning the functions thanks to your documentation

>though there were some problems as you know about the template, though it seems you have fixed that

>I really have nothing to say other than that

### How I implemented his feedback

There wasn't any criticism, so I didn't change anything. At first he had an outdated template, which caused some errors but that was quickly resolved. He did find a couple typos in the docs so I fixed those.

> I like how efficient the implementations of all the functions were, and not having to know how the library works to use it is a big plus

> also the documentation / commenting was great

> as for suggestions - it would be cool to have color in some way, but I have no idea how doable that is

### How I implemented his feedback

Again there wasn't any criticism. He suggested adding colour, which is a cool idea, but it doesn't really fit the visual theme of the library. It would involve re-writing some stuff, so I think it'd be better as a project than part of the library.
