# Advice for myself if I were to do it again

- Get the easy stuff out of the way first, not the hard stuff
- Don't waste so much time trying to make 3d stuff work, you could've added more basic functionality
- Document as you go along!!!

# Hardest part of the project

Despite it not actually working, the 3d stuff was definitely the hardest. I had to not ony learn math, but learn to implement it. However, in terms of things that actually contributed to the final product, I had a lot of trouble with the line function. I was trying to start with a fancy algorithm, instead of starting simple. As a result, I never actually got around to improving the line algorithm. The documenation also proved challenging, because as I've found out, there's a fine line between not giving enough detail and giving way too much. It is difficult to explain something while trying to be both clear and concise.

# Did I complete the Needs list?
yes

# What am I most proud of?
This is subjective, but I am most proud of how simple (in my opinion) it is to use my library. If you already know p5, it takes almost no effort to starting writing stuff with AR:p5. I am quite pleased with how seamless the whole thing is, and I think the visuals themselves also look quite polished. There are very few visual glitches and no lag.
