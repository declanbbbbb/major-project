# `charCircle()`

## Description
`charCircle()` draws a circle on the sketch centered at `x`, `y`. Analagous to `circle()` in p5. Note: the radius **is** affected by [`setCoordinateMode()`](setCoordinateMode) and it is expressed **horizontally**. That is, that if `coordinateMode` is set to `CHAR`, `r` will refer to the number of characters going horizontally as the radius.

## Syntax
`charCircle(x, y, r)`
> `x`: X coordinate of the centre point

> `y`: Y coordinate of the centre point

> `r`: Radius of the circle

## Returns
Nothing
